## Graph Neural Networks and Policy Gradients to Solve the Maximum Independent Set Problem

We present a novel GNN-based architecture to solve the Maximum Independent Set problem. Utilizing policy gradients to combine GNNs with reinforcement learning as well as a Markov Decision Process framework built specifically for this problem, we demonstrate state of the art results on datasets from the Stanford Large Network Dataset Collection. Detailed motivations and descriptions can be found in the attached PDF.
